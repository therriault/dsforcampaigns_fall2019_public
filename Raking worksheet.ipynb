    "* a dataset formatted as a dataframe with named columns (in the example, 'gender', 'race', and 'location')\n",
    "* a set of target marginal distributions for each of the variables to be weighted upon, as a dictionary with the first key as the column name in the dataset and the second key as the column value in the dataset, with the value of that second key being the desired proportion\n",
    "* the number of iterations to run for (start small and then observe if convergence occurs)\n",

    "The algorithm I use here is very simple and doesn't account for things like trimming of extreme weights, but will work for this purpose (look at actual weighting packages for more detailed versions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that after every iteration, I store the weights on each variable that apply to each individual in the main dataframe and recalculate those as a series of successive column multiplications. There's probably a more efficient way to do this which doesn't require setting all those column vaues and instead just applies weights based on characteristics all at once (and that's what I did in an earlier version of this using just two variables), but figuring out how to do that join for an arbitrary number of variables included in weighting makes it a lot more complicated. So if someone wants to submit a pull request for a better version, go for it, but this works fine and any CPU / memory inefficiency is negligible at this scale."

    "##### So the takeaway here is that the unweighted analysis provided a biased estimate, while the weighted analysis got substantially closer to the actual value of 0.15. And the true result was within the 95% confidence interval, though that's not guaranteed. (You can try setting different sample sizes and random seeds at the beginning and see how these results change - as sample sizes increase, the weighted result will converge on the true value, but the unweighted result will not.)"
